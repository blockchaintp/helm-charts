# Un-deploying a deployment

## Steps

1. Go to Sextant web interface.  Click on the control in the top left corner,
   and select "Deployments"

2. In the deployment list find the deployment you want to undeploy.

3. Click on the "Undeploy" ico to the right of the deployment entry.  As of
   Sextant 2.1 this looks like the road symbol for "do not enter".

4. You will be prompted to confirm the undeployment by retyping the deployment
   name.
